# Waivers

Purpose: Defines waiver requirements and constraints for the guarded workflow.

Waivers are not approvals.

A waiver requires explicit user approval plus:

- named risk
- waiver scope
- follow-up or expiry condition

Without those fields, `needs_waiver` findings result in `waiver_required`, not `approved`.
